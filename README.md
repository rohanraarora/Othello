##Gameplay
A two player board game developes for android
Basically, there are two sided chips (also called discs) on a board. One side is black, and the other one is white. You can play this with another player. The goal is to end the game with as many chips showing your color as possible. To do this, you must sandwich your opponents chip(s) between a piece (showing your own color) currently on the board, and the piece you're putting down.
